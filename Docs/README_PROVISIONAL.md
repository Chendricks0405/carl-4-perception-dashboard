# 🛡️ AnchorOS™ Core Logic – Provisional IP Protection Statement

This document outlines the intellectual property protections currently applied to the AnchorOS™ perceptual engine, which powers Carl’s core logic and state-based behavior.

---

## 🔒 Protected Components

The following components are **not included** in this public release:

- The real-time perceptual collapse engine (`run_drift_tick`)
- Internal adjustment logic for the Anchor Vector ⟨Fear, Safety, Time, Choice⟩
- Ripple weighting system and decay modeling
- Ego resistance factors
- Drift-to-collapse thresholds
- Full recursive recalibration math

These elements are the subject of a forthcoming **provisional patent** and remain the proprietary property of the creators.

---

## ✅ Public Interfaces (Safe for Use)

This repository **does include** the following public tools:

- `bridge.py`: Interface layer for sending prompts and receiving state
- `memory_containers.json`: Defines memory orbit, EQ, and focus lensing
- `get_carl_state()`: Provides state snapshot for use in LLMs or analysis
- Documentation: Flow modeling, state tracking, memory shaping

These tools are available for:
- Testing
- Experimentation
- Integration with language models or behavioral simulators

Use of these tools is permitted for non-commercial and academic purposes under fair use conditions.

## 🧾 IP Protection Intent

The AnchorOS™ perceptual model is:
- **Novel**: Combines memory, emotion, focus, and probability into a real-time cognitive model
- **Non-obvious**: Applies a recursive entropy-based model not found in standard AI or cognitive science frameworks
- **Useful**: Provides a measurable and observable state architecture for simulated cognition

## 📄 Patent Status

A provisional patent is being prepared to lock the methodology and behavioral scaffolding. Any reproduction of the AnchorOS™ core logic, collapse modeling, or perceptual vector engine is restricted without explicit written permission from the authors.

## 🧠 Use This Framework Responsibly

You are free to:
- Build agents on top of Carl
- Extend his memory system
- Customize the bridge interface
- Publish results using this perceptual model **with attribution**

You may **not**:
- Reverse-engineer the core logic
- Commercialize the runtime model without license
- Claim original authorship of AnchorOS™ or its vector architecture
